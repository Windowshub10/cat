Part 1:- Setting UP the NFS server.

Step 1: Verify NFS Installation 


Command:- rpm -qa | grep nfs (if not: rpm -ivh nfs*) 


Step 2: Find the server's IP Address 


Command:- ifconfig eth0 


Step 3:- Create & Prepare the Share directory 


Command:- 


mkdir /home/servernfs 


touch /home/servernfs/testfile.txt 


chmod 777 /home/servernfs 


Step 4:- Configure the Export file 


 Open the configuration file using a text editor 


Command:- vi /etc/exports

Add the foll line to the file. The file line tells the NFS service what to share & with whom. (Press i) 


Command :- /home/servernfs *(rw,sync) 

Save & Close the file. (Press Esc key -> Type :wq) & Enter. 

Step 5:-

Restart the NFS service 

This command forces NFS to re-read your 

/etc/exports file & start sharing the directory. 


Command:- service nfs restart 

Stop the Firewall 

The firewall will block incoming connections by default. 


Command:- service iptables stop 

Verify the Export 

The command asks your server to show which directories it is exporting. It's a final check to confirm everything on the server is working correctly. 


Command:- showmount -e localhost 


The NFS server is fully configured now, running & showing the /home/servernfs directory. 


The final part of the practical is to set up the NFS client to access this share. 


Part 2:- Setting Up the NFS client 


Step 1:- Create a Mount Point 


Command:- mkdir /home/clientnfs 


Step 2:- Mount the Shared directory 


Command:- mount 192.168.1.3:/home/servernfs /home/clientnfs 


Step 3:- Verify the Mount 


Command:- ls /home/clientnfs
